# ML-projects

This repository contains various projects completed during my Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition course. The projects demonstrate my understanding and application of a range of machine learning techniques.

## Key Techniques
- Expectation-Maximization algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models
- Minimum Expected Risk classification method
- Multilayer Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines
- Gaussian Mixture Model-based clustering

All projects were implemented using Python. For more details, please refer to the individual project folders
